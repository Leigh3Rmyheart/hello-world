# hello-world
This repository is for learning with SOAR.
I am a person who has had some struggles with technology! I use to at times, get frustrated with it and become very impatient. Learning new things with technology has always been an intrest of mine but like I said I am impatitent and I gave up to easily when I become frustrated with it. Now days I have gained some patience and do not easily get exhauxsted with anything anymore, so I became interested in learning new things that has great benefits to learning. With that being said I can now let you in on a secret that I have little experience in technology and only kmow the basics of any IoT and I hope that I catch on to coding easily. About me I am a mom of three from the boonies in Kentucky. I am 41 years old and ready for this challenge.
